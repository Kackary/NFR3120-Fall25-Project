## Project Idea
We are building a Task Tracker web application. The site will let users log in, and create, view, update, and delete tasks. It will help people organize and manage their work easily.  

The home page shows all tasks in a table. Users can add new tasks using a button. Tasks can also be edited or deleted from the table, if logged in. 

The site currently locks users to only view tasks and not edit, delete, or create tasks until registered then logged in. 


## Features
- Landing/Home Page with Team Name and Logo  
- Add new tasks (Create)  
- View all tasks (Read)  
- Edit tasks (Update)  
- Delete tasks (Delete)  
- Fully functional CRUD operations  
- Login security
- Register and Login pages
